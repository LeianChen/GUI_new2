# GEOG5990M Practical Output
The final agent-based model practical work for assessment.


The agent-based model sets up parameters for agents and randomizes the order of agent actions. The model reads in a 2D environmental data and gets agents to interact with each other in the environment. Agents have methods of move, eat, and share. They can move around the environment to eat and share their store with their neighbours. The model is displayed as an animation within a GUI and reads the data from the web to initialise.
